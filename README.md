This isn't an epic i3 rice showcase to be honest I just upladed it for myself, but I made it public because why not.
If you want you can copy it or pick out what you like, or anything really. Have fun with it!

## Prerequisites:
You have to install `feh, xclip, scrot, i3blocks` and `xcompmgr` from pacman repos and `transset-df` from the AUR.
You'll also have to make an folder named "Images" in your home folder for screenshots to save wich are made with mod+Printscreen.
(Printscreen saves images to your clipboard)
