This isn't an epic i3 rice showcase to be honest I just upladed it for myself, but I made it public because why not.
If you want you can copy it or pick out what you like, or anything really. Have fun with it!

## Prerequisites:
You have to install `feh, xclip, scrot, i3blocks` and `xcompmgr` from pacman repos and `transset-df` from the AUR.
You'll also have to make an folder named "Images" in your home folder for screenshots to save wich are made with mod+Printscreen.
(Printscreen saves images to your clipboard)
## Usage:
### Printscreen
The `Mod+Printscreen` saves files to the `~/Images` folder. (`Printscreen` itself just copies screenshots to the clipboard)
### Aliases
**i3edit** - edits the ~/.config/i3/config file with vim.\n

**weather** - gives a weather forcast from the terminal
